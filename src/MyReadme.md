Open VSCode
Open Project Folder
Run Terminal
Initialize React by typing "npx create-react-app project-folder" into the terminal
Click on package.json and check for required dependencies
If no web-vitals, type into terminal "npm i web-vitals --save-dev" to install it (though i am not sure what this is for)
Plan on what components you will need for your app
Visit https://react.dev/learn to learn React
Install the react router
Refer to https://reactrouter.com/start/library/routing for help

I started with app.js
I made a components folder, and made a file named header.js
This file will be the layout of my app
I then created a pages folder from the src folder and made the landing pages for the items in my nav menu (Home, About, Services, abd Contact)
Exported the functions of each page
Started styling the app by editing App.css
Was able to impelemt color contrasts, hover effect, active background, etc into it
Was able to link to the pages when i clicked on an item on the nav menu

Started to make the hamburger menu
This react feature was initialized by typing "npm i hamburger-react" into the terminal
Since i am not that good in coding yet, i researched some ways to implement the hamburger menu into the page. I watched several tutorials and started coding
I created another js file which i named navbar,js
Started imnporting and exporting functions so that my components and pages were linked
Created Navbar.css and adjusted the style. I wasn't able to figure out how to make the active option stay on screen and remain highlighted as when I had the first code without the hamburger effect
I visited https://hamburger-react.netlify.app/ to get an idea but to no avail
But I managed to make the hamburger menu work when the screen width was reduced into mobile view and the links to the pages were clickable.

I think the hamburger menu is a very good example of how a responsive design works. It is also widely used by most apps like facebook, spotife, etc
I am going to master coding someday.

- it is worth noting that my node_modules folder has been grayed out the whole time i was coding. I'm not sure if that's normal. And also, the new folders and files that i made are white, I'm not sure if it matters or not but it sure feels a bit wrong when it's not green like the other files.
